# Colombia-Marxan-Analysis
# This program is an example of how a Marxan Analysis can be utilized to aid in biodiversity conservation efforts. Marxan is an optimization program that selects areas (planning units) based on a variety of parameters including but not limited to cost of land, threat level to species, and spatial relationships of planning units. Marxan and this assosciated analysis selects areas for conservation based on a balance between threat level of biodviersity and the cost of land. Cost of land is taken into account due to conservation efforts being increasingly more expensive as the cost of land increases. In this case, cost of land is first parameterized simply as the area of the planning unit and second as a function of travel time to a major city.
